Hi, 

My name is Elena Coffey. 
I begun to learn coding about 5 month ago, although introduced myself to coding a year ago.  

This github is just a trial for my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. There are links that are not linked to any pages and no particular design on pages that I've built so far.

There was no intention to demonstrate any UI or UX skills either, although I dived into this topics too, moustly through online courses on YouTube and using local library resources. Just did not have a chance to incorporate them into any of my projects as I am still at an entry level of my coding journey. But I am passionate about it and this passion will lead me to become better and better in it. 
Browse through my other projects to see where I am at. 
I enjoy solving problems and like to draw ( I tought myself to draw at a very early age, so by 9 I draw as someone who would take several courses at an art school. By participating in drawing contests in my mid and high school, I consistently won 1st places thanks to my creative ideas and love for drawing.
I also love math. Therefore, coding alows me to use both of these skills.

And if you would like to discuss any topics related to my projects or the level of my coding skill, you can find my contact info on my LinkedIn account:
